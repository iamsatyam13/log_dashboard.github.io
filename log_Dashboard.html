<h1 align=Center>Too many Numbers...what does they say?</h1>
<h3> HTTP STATUS CODE...</h3>
<h5> 301 :  Requested resource has been definitively moved to the URL given by the Location headers.</h5>
<h5> 400 : The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.</h5>
<h5> 206 :  Request has succeeded and the body contains the requested ranges of data, as described in the Range header of the request.</h5>
<h5> 404 : Page Not Found.</h5>
<h5> 302 :  Resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location header.</h5>
<h5> 405 : The server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method.</h5>
<h5> 204 : It indicates that a request has succeeded, but that the client doesn't need to navigate away from its current page.</h5>
<h5> 304 : Indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources.</h5>
<h5> 500 : The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.</h5>
<br><br>

<h1 align=Center>What is Method?</h1>

<h5> Web clients and servers communicate by using a request/response protocol called HTTP, which is an acronym for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP includes two methods for retrieving and manipulating data:<br><br>

<b>GET</b><br> 
Retrieves data from the server. The target of the request (referred to as a resource) is specified as a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). This is usually (but not always) an absolute reference to a file on the server and is referred to as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) when used in this context. Additional parameters, called Query Parameters, can also be specified.<br><br>

<b>POST </b><br>
Posts data back to the server. In addition to a URL and query parameters, a POST request includes a payload. The payload is usually form data, the aggregated contents of the various fields (also called controls) that were in the response.
</h5> <br><br>


<h1 align=Center>What is Protocol?</h1>
<h5>
  A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.
  <br><br>
  <b>HTTP 1.0</b><br>
  HTTP 1.0 introduces a number of new features, including the ability to connect to multiple servers at the same time, support for persistent connections, and support for the POST method.

  <br><br>
  <b>HTTP 1.1</b><br>
  HTTP 1.1 is the latest version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the World Wide Web application protocol that runs on top of the Internet's TCP/IP suite of protocols. HTTP 1.1 provides faster delivery of Web pages than the original HTTP and reduces Web traffic.
</h5>

<br><br>
<h1 align=Center>What is Endpoint?</h1>
<h5>
  A web service endpoint is an <b>entity, processor, or resource that can be referenced and to which web services messages can be addressed.</b> Endpoint references convey the information needed to address a web service endpoint. Clients need to know this information before they can access a service.
</h5>
<br><br>
<h1 align=Center>What is Content Size?</h1>
<h5>
The Content size/Content-Length header indicates the size of the message body, in bytes, sent to the recipient.
</h5>

<br><br>
<h1 align=Center>What is Anomaly/Anomaly Detection?</h1>
<h5>
 Anomaly is data points in data that don't fit the normal patterns. <br>
Anomaly detection is the process of finding outliers in a given dataset. Outliers are the data objects that stand out amongst other objects in the dataset and do not conform to the normal behavior in a dataset.</h5>
